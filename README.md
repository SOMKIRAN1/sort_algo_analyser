# sort_algo_analyser
📖 Introduction

This project is a Flask-based web application that visualizes popular sorting algorithms in action.
It helps learners and developers understand how different algorithms work by showing step-by-step array transformations, explanations, and highlights for each operation (comparisons, swaps, pivots, etc.).

It’s a great educational tool for students, teachers, and anyone preparing for coding interviews.
